# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application

The CLI class in cli.rb welcomes the user and presents the first 5 coffee roasters with their names, locations and summary of their beans. I listed the beans to entice them to read more about it.
The user can chose to read about the coffee roasters by entering a number or see lists for more coffee roasters or exit the program.


- [x] Pull data from an external source

The Scraper class in scraper.rb scrapes the data from the Thrillist site (https://www.thrillist.com/drink/nation/the-21-best-coffee-roasters-in-the-country).
It scrapes the name, location, summary of the beans, details and url of each coffee roasters.


- [x] Implement both list and detail views

From the cli, the user can list coffee roasters or read details about each roasters.
